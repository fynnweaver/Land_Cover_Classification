# Land_Cover_Classification
AISC workshop learning project tackling ML classification using remote sensing (Sentinal) data

Main coding workflow occurs in `ModelWorkflow.ipynb` and contains EDA, feature selection and modeling steps. Custom functions used for this project can all be found in the `custom_functions.py` file. The outcomes of different model iterations can be found in the folder `confusion_matrices`. The legend for this folder is within the `ModelWorkflow` notebook under the section `Modeling`. Individual experiments with image processing can be found in `ImageExperiments.ipynb`.
