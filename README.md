# Land_Cover_Classification
AISC workshop learning project tackling ML classification using remote sensing (Sentinal) data

Main coding workflow occurs in `ModelWorkflow.ipynb` and contains EDA, feature selection and modeling steps. Custom functions used for this project can all be found in the `custom_functions.py` file. The outcomes of different model iterations can be found in the folder `evaluation`. The legend for the different model versions and pre-processing steps can be found in `evaluation_legend.md`. Individual experiments with image processing can be found in `ImageExperiments.ipynb`. `Ensemble.ipynb` contains work attempting to combine different shallow ML models for a more robust predictor.
